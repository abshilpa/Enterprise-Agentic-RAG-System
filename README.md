# Enterprise Agentic RAG System 🚀

## Overview
This project implements a **production-ready Enterprise Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** designed to answer complex questions over internal company documents.

The system combines **LLMs, vector databases, agent orchestration, tool calling, evaluation, and API deployment** to demonstrate how modern GenAI systems can be safely and reliably used in real-world enterprise environments.

This project is built end-to-end with a **production mindset**, including evaluation, observability, and deployment considerations.

## Business Problem
Enterprises store critical knowledge across PDFs, documents, and internal files. Traditional keyword search fails to provide:
- Context-aware answers
- Reasoning across multiple documents
- Explainability and traceability

This system enables:
- Intelligent document question answering
- Agent-based reasoning
- Auditable and reproducible AI outputs
